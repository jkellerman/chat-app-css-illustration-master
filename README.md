### What I learned

The main things i learned from this challenge were how to create my own arrow icons using, transform(skew) as I wasn't able to find the icon i was looking for in fontawesome or similar websites. I learned how to use border-radius to create the shape of a phone. Also, firefox was resizing a div and looked different to how it looked in chrome and safari, so I learned how to change this using @media moz-document.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Targeting only firefox</h1>
```

```css
@-moz-document url-prefix() {
  .iphone-container {
    height: 508px;
  }
```

### Useful resources

- [Create Chevron](https://codepen.io/stepher/pen/yLOaEOP) - This helped me for creating a chevron icon.
- [Skew](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-function/skew()>) - This helped me for changing the angle of the chevron to get it looking closer to the icon in the design.
- [Fancy border Radius Generator](https://9elements.github.io/fancy-border-radius/) - This is an amazing tool which is a life saver when you are trying to get the perfect borders. This helped me a lot when making the container for the phone.
